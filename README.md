This code was developed in order to fulfill the AOL (Assurance of Learning) final project in the Speech Recognition course. This code raises the theme of detecting Deep Fake voices that are usually made by AI by comparing them with the original human voice. The purpose of this development is to facilitate users to maintain security in preventing the possibility of fraud by deep fake voices. This code was developed using the Python language using the Naive Bayes, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors, and SVC (Support Vector Classifier) method approach.
